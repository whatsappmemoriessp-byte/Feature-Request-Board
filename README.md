## Overview

The **Stellar Feature Request Board** is a Web3-native governance and feedback board. Instead of central databases, every single user actionwhether submitting a new feature idea or casting an upvoteis built, signed, and recorded directly on the **Stellar Testnet blockchain** as metadata payment transactions. 

The application features a sleek, utilitarian, developer-tool-inspired UI featuring a gorgeous light/dark mode, fully responsive bento layouts, fluid Framer Motion list transitions, and on-chain verification links straight to the **StellarExpert explorer**!
